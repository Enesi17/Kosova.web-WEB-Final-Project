# Kosova.web-WEB-Final-Project
Final project of my Web Technology course.

This project was the last project of the course. The concept was to make a website using html and css that promotes your country or city to the world, I tried to introduce both my country and city. Time was limited, so I couldn't do much research, the articles on the site are my writings, the photos are taken from different sources. The design was supposed to express country motifs so I chose the gold design.
